# Overview
This repo contains files needed to link a Visual Studio 2013 generated static library with Rust. I have included the static library file with the repo so that you can try things out without installing Visual Studio.

##Building
Just run ``build.bat`` to run ``rustc``. It will try to link in the static library ``MySimpleLibrary\Release\MySimpleLibrary.lib``.
